# Ensemble Learning

A Classification project of a tabular dataset using Ensemble Learning, and 10 different models under three different dimensionality reduction techniques (None, PCA, and LDA) as well as eight evaluation metrics with a 3-fold cross-validation setup to provide a better insight into the performance of the model. The project achieved high results (E.g. 97% accuracy) with a low standard deviation of 0.002, suggesting a stable performance across different runs, which is a valuable result.
